    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The India men's national cricket team represents India in men's international cricket. It is governed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and is a Full Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.</p>
    <p>The team played its first international match on 25 June 1932 in a Test against England at Lord's Cricket Ground in London, becoming the sixth team to be granted Test cricket status. India's first Test victory was in 1952, and success was limited in the team's first fifty years of international cricket, with only 35 wins in 196 Tests.[10] However, they gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of the Indian spin quartet, and players like Sunil Gavaskar, Gundappa Viswanath, and Kapil Dev. In men's limited-overs cricket, India made its ODI debut against England in 1974 and its T20I debut against South Africa in 2006.</p>
    <p>India's men's national cricket team has won five major ICC tournaments, winning the Cricket World Cup twice (1983 and 2011),[11] the ICC T20 World Cup once (2007) and the ICC Champions Trophy twice (2002 and 2013). They have also finished as runners-up in the World Cup twice (2003 and 2023), the T20 World Cup once (2014), the Champions Trophy twice (2000 and 2017) and the ICC World Test Championship finals in the first two editions (2021, 2023). India was the second team (after the West Indies) to win the World Cup, and the first to win the competition on home soil after winning it in 2011.

        They have won the Asia Cup eight times, in 1984, 1988, 1990‍–‍91, 1995, 2010, 2016, 2018 and 2023; and have finished runners-up three times (1997, 2004, 2008). India also won a gold medal in the 2022 Asian Games. Other achievements include winning the ICC Test Championship Mace five times and the ICC ODI Championship Shield once. As of May 2024, the team is top of the ICC rankings for ODIs and T20Is and second in tests behind Australian Cricket Team.[12] With such success, it is one of the most successful teams in international cricket.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Early history (1700s–1918)</h3>
    <p>The British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first cricket match played in 1721.[14] It was played and adopted by Kolis of Gujarat because they were sea pirates and outlaws who always loot the British ships so East India Company tried to manage the Kolis in cricket and been successful.[15][16][17] In 1848, the Parsi community in Mumbai formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians. After slow beginnings, the Europeans eventually invited the Parsis to play a match in 1877.[18] By 1912, the Parsis, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims of Bombay played a quadrangular tournament with the Europeans every year.[18] In the early 1900s, some Indians went on to play for the England cricket team. Some of these, such as Ranjitsinhji and Duleepsinhji were greatly appreciated by the British and their names went on to be used for the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy – two major first-class tournaments in India. In 1911, an Indian men's cricket team, captained by Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, went on their first official tour of the British Isles, but only played English county teams and not the England cricket team.[19][20]

    </p> 
    <h3>Test match status (1918–1970)</h3> 
    <p>India was invited to the International Cricket Council in 1926, and made their debut as a Test playing nation in England in 1932, led by CK Nayudu, who was considered the best Indian batsman at the time.[21] The one-off Test match between the two sides was played at Lord's in London. The team was not strong in their batting[22] at this point and went on to lose by 158 runs.[23] India hosted its first men's Test cricket series in 1933. England was the visiting team that played two Tests in Bombay (now Mumbai) and Calcutta (now Kolkata). The visitors won the series 2–0. The Indian team continued to improve throughout the 1930s and 1940s but did not achieve an international victory during this period. In the early 1940s, India did not play any men's Test cricket due to World War II. The team's first series as an independent country was in late 1947 against Don Bradman's Australian cricket team in England in 1948 (a name given to the Australia national cricket team of that time). It was also the first Test series India played which was not against England. Australia men's cricket team won the five-match series 4–0, with Bradman tormenting the Indian bowling in his final Australian summer.[24] India subsequently played their first Test series at home not against England, but against the West Indies in 1948. West Indies won the five Test series 1–0.</p>
    <p>India recorded their first Test victory, in their 24th match, against England at Madras in 1952.[27] Later in the same year, they won their first Test series, which was against Pakistan.[28] They continued their improvement throughout the early 1950s with a series win against New Zealand in 1956. However, they did not win again in the remainder of the decade and lost badly to strong Australian and English sides. On 24 August 1959, India lost by an innings in the Test to complete the only 5–0 whitewash ever inflicted by England.[29] The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home. They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961–62 and also won a home series against New Zealand. They managed to draw home series against Pakistan and Australia and another series against England. In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967–68.</p>
    <h3>Late 20th century (1985–2000)</h3>
    <p>The addition of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team. The following year, Javagal Srinath, India's fastest bowler since Amar Singh made his debut. Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the subcontinent while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home. After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the 1996 Cricket World Cup semi-final, the team underwent a year of change as Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's. Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998.</p>
    <h3>21st century</h3>
    <p>The team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman Ajay Jadeja were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five-year bans respectively.[48][49] This period was described by the BBC as "the Indian cricket's worst hour".[50] However, the new core – Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly – swore not to let this happen to them again, and led Indian cricket out of the dark times. The first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era</p>
    <p>The Indian team underwent major improvements under the captaincy of Ganguly and the guidance of John Wright, India's first foreign coach.[52][53] In the Kolkata Test match, India became only the third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on. Australian captain Steve Waugh labelled India as the "Final Frontier" because of his side's inability to win a Test series in India.[54] In 2002, India were joint-winners of the ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka and then went to the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa, where they reached the final, only to be beaten by Australia. A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting second.</p>
    <p>In September 2007, India won the first-ever ICC Men's T20 World Cup held in South Africa, beating Pakistan by five runs in the final.[56] On 2 April 2011, India won the 2011 Cricket World Cup by defeating Sri Lanka in the final, thus becoming the third team after West Indies and Australia to win the World Cup twice.[57] India also became the first team to win the World Cup on home soil.[58] India defeated England in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy Final and captain M. S. Dhoni became the first men's cricket team captain in history to win the three major ICC trophies, namely the Cricket World Cup, ICC Men's T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy.</p>

    <h2>Governing body</h2>
    <p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the governing body for the Indian cricket team and first-class cricket in India. The Board has been operating since 1929 and represents India at the International Cricket Council (ICC). Its headquarters is situated in the 'Cricket centre' at Churchgate in Mumbai, Maharashtra. Amongst the richest sporting organisations in the world, it sold media rights for India's matches from 2006 to 2010 for $612,000,000.[76] Roger Binny is present BCCI president and Jay Shah is secretary.

        The International Cricket Council determines India's upcoming matches through its future tours program. However, the BCCI, with its influential financial position in the cricketing world, has often challenged the ICC's program and called for more series between India, Australia and England which are more likely to earn more revenue as opposed to tours with Bangladesh or Zimbabwe.[77] In the past, the BCCI has also come into conflict with the ICC regarding sponsorships</p>
